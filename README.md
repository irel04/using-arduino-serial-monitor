# Problem 1
Write a sketch that applies bonus scores to given scores in the range [1..9]. The program reads a digit as an input. If the digit is between 1 and 3, the program  multiplies  it  by  10;  if  it  is  between  4 xand  6,  multiplies  it  by  100;  if  it  is between 7 and 9, multiplies it by 1000. If it is zero or if the value is not a digit, the program  must  report  an  error.  Create  two  program  versions,  one  that  uses  a switch  statement  and  the  other  one  uses  nested  if-else  statement  and  at  the end print the calculated new value in the serial monitor.
